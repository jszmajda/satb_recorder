> Hey! I had an idea for a webapp. I love to sing, and my range is pretty broad, so I'd like to record 
myself singing 4 part harmony (SATB). I want to be able to record multiple tracks for each voice, and 
then to multiplex them all together to listen and re-record certain tracks, adjust the volume of certain 
tracks relative to the others, and then eventually downmix the tracks into a resulting compressed audio 
file. I think I can build all this as a single page app that runs in the browser locally, although I 
might have to use a local webserver to deal with some browser security issues? 

The layout I'm thinking for the app is something like this?

 New | Save | Load | Export

 Metronome: (-) 120 (+) [ visual flash tick indicator ]

 Tracks:
  
  (playhead:)         v
  S1 --------/----\----/-/----//----\-\\\\(sparkline)
  S2 --------/----\----/-/----//----\-\\\\(sparkline)
  S3 --------/----\----/-/----//----\-\\\\(sparkline)
  S4 --------/----\----/-/----//----\-\\\\(sparkline)

What do you think? Is this doable with a local React app? 

⏺ This is absolutely doable as a local React app! This is a really cool project. The browser's Web Audio
  API gives you everything you need for recording, playback, mixing, and export.

  Here's what's great about your plan:

  Technically Feasible:
  - Recording: MediaRecorder API can capture microphone input
  - Playback & Mixing: AudioContext and GainNode for volume control per track
  - Visualization: AnalyserNode for waveform sparklines
  - Metronome: Easy with Web Audio API's precise timing
  - Export: You can mix down all tracks and export as WAV/MP3
  - Storage: Save/Load projects using IndexedDB or localStorage (for smaller projects)

  Local Server:
  You'll want a dev server (which React gives you automatically with Vite/CRA) because:
  - Microphone access requires HTTPS or localhost
  - Makes development much easier

  Some questions to help me understand your vision better:

  1. Recording workflow: When recording a new track, do you want to hear the existing tracks playing back
   (with metronome)? This is typical for overdubbing.
  2. Track controls: For each track, do you want:
    - Solo/Mute buttons?
    - Individual volume sliders?
    - Re-record button?
    - Delete button?
  3. Waveform interaction: Should clicking on the sparkline set the playhead position?
  4. Export format: MP3, WAV, or both?
  5. Tech stack preference: Plain React, or are you open to using audio libraries like Tone.js (makes
  audio programming much easier)?

  Want me to start building a basic version to demonstrate the core functionality?

> Great questions! 

1. I'd like the option of overdubbing or just singing to the metronome. The metronome should be visual or
 audible, but visual would be the priority. I don't often use wired headphones these days so it's hard to
 overdub when I'm on the road.. but sometimes I'd like the option.

2. yes those buttons are perfect, but I don't need re-record (I'd just delete and record a new track). 
Probably the row is (del) (trackname) (solo) (mute) (horiz volume slider) (sparkline visualizer)

3. Yes, I'd like to be able to est the playhead position. I could also choose to record a new track only 
from the playhead position.. but that's a very secondary use-case.

4. both!

5. I'm down with whatever you'd recommend. Would we use something like next.js or vite also?

Let's make a plan and, when we're aligned, write a design doc for the project first that details our 
choices. 

⏺ Great! Let me put together a plan for this. I'm thinking through the architecture and technical
  choices.

  My Recommendations:

  Tech Stack:
  - Vite + React - Perfect for a pure client-side app. Much faster than Next.js and we don't need SSR
  - Tone.js - Amazing for metronome, transport (playhead), and precise timing. We can still use raw Web
  Audio API where needed
  - Zustand - Lightweight state management (better than Context for complex audio state)
  - Tailwind CSS - Fast styling, easy to make clean UI
  - IndexedDB (via Dexie.js) - For storing audio blobs (localStorage is too small)
  - lamejs - For MP3 encoding in the browser

  Architecture Approach:
  - Separation of concerns: Audio engine (Tone.js/Web Audio) separate from React UI
  - Modular design: Recording, playback, mixing, export as separate modules
  - Project structure: Store project metadata + audio blob references

  Key Design Decisions to Align On:

  1. Audio format: Store tracks as uncompressed WAV in IndexedDB (for quality), only compress on export?
  2. Metronome visual: Thinking a pulsing circle/square that changes color on beat 1? Or something else?
  3. Track grouping: Should SATB groups be collapsible/expandable in the UI?
  4. Max tracks: Any limit per voice part? (helps with UI planning)
  5. Undo/Redo: Want this for delete operations?

  Let me create a TodoList for this planning phase:

⏺ What do you think about those questions? Once we align on these details, I'll write a comprehensive
  design doc covering:

  - Architecture overview
  - Technology choices & rationale
  - Data models (project/track structure)
  - Core features & workflows
  - UI/UX specifications
  - File structure
  - Implementation phases

> 1. yes store as wav locally and only compress on export
2. just a simple box that flashes on each beat. We don't need to track time signature for now, it just 
has to be able to stand out in my peripheral vision while I'm reading the music I'm singing
3. collapse/expand would be nice to have, yes
4. I really doubt I'll have more than 8 tracks per part ever.. most of the time I'll have 1-4
5. yeah.. undo for delete would be nice, but we don't have to have more than one undo level.

Let's also be sure to indicate that we need to build this using TDD with a red-green-refactor loop! 

⏺ Perfect! I've got everything I need. Let me write a comprehensive technical design document.

     # SATB Harmony Recorder - Technical Design Document
     ## Project Overview
     A browser-based single-page application for recording multi-track SATB (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass)
     vocal harmonies. Users can record multiple takes per voice part, overdub while listening to existing
      tracks, mix with individual track controls, and export the final mix as compressed audio.

⏺ I've created a comprehensive technical design document at /Users/jess/src/recorder/DESIGN.md!

  Key Highlights:

  Tech Stack:
  - Vite + React + TypeScript
  - Tone.js for audio timing & metronome
  - Zustand for state management
  - Dexie.js for IndexedDB storage
  - Tailwind CSS for styling
  - Vitest + React Testing Library for TDD

  Architecture:
  - Modular audio engine (Recorder, Mixer, Metronome, Visualizer, Exporter)
  - Clear separation between UI and audio logic
  - IndexedDB for storing WAV blobs + project metadata

  Data Models:
  - Project → VoiceParts (S/A/T/B) → Tracks (max 8 per part)
  - Single-level undo for deletions
  - Volume stored as 0-100, mapped to gain 0-1

  Implementation:
  - 10 phases, each using TDD red-green-refactor loop
  - Starting with foundation, then audio engine, then UI
  - Full test coverage with mocked Web Audio API

  Please review the design doc and let me know:
  1. Does this align with your vision?
  2. Any changes or additions needed?
  3. Ready to start implementation?

  Once you approve, we'll begin with Phase 1: Project setup and foundation! 🎵

> Great! some feedback:

1. Let's note that I might have multiple microphones connected, and need to be able to choose among them 
in the interface. 

2. each (visible) sparkline should show a visual progression of the playhead as well as the playhead 
moving. This doesn't have to be complex - whatever's simplest.

3. bpm should be adjustable by typing a new value as well as clicking + or - buttons

4. count-in is brilliant, thank you for catching that!

5. during recording, I should see a VU indicator showing microphone activity. We can just show that where
 the sparkline would be for the new track I'm recording.

6. the overdub record interface is odd.. I think it'd be easier to have a simple toggle switch somewhere 
in the interface for overdubbing or not. Default is not (and override-mutes all tracks during recording).
 If enabled, it respects the current mute/solo selections per track.

7. Mute interface - instead of adjusting GainNode it should just set an override 'muted' boolean, that 
way we don't lose the Gain setting that I might have adjusted.

8. seek - I should also be able to drag the playhead to a new position

9. let's actually adjust the new/save behavior - New should always prompt for a project name (which can 
show to the right of Export), then any changes are always saved immediately (and we can remove the need 
for any explicit save). We can add a "delete project" button to the right of the project name in that 
header bar.

10. to the open questions / enhancements - those future features are definitely not in scope for now. The
 wav storage is fine.. and we don't have to worry about browser compat - I'm happy to use the latest 
Chromium series browsers.

11. Performance targets aren't super important right now. The laptop I'm using is kind of a potato 
anyway.

Does that all make sense? If so, let's adjust this design file, move it to docs/, then add EARS-format 
specs (per https://alistairmavin.com/ears/, e.g. "(spec-id): (description)" one per line), move out the 
implementation plan into its own file and add a checklist that refers back to the EARS specs. 

⏺ Perfect feedback! Let me update the design doc with all those changes, restructure it with EARS specs,
  and organize the files properly.

       362    ## Testing Strategy
       363    
       364    ### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
       365    **Red-Green-Refactor Loop:**
       366 -  1. **Red**: Write failing test for new feature
       366 +  1. **Red**: Write failing test for new feature/requirement
       367    2. **Green**: Write minimal code to pass test
       368    3. **Refactor**: Clean up code while keeping tests green
       369    
       370 +  All EARS requirements should have corresponding tests. Each requirement ID (e.g., 
           + PROJ-001) should map to one or more test cases.
       371 +

       444 -  ## Implementation Phases
       444 +  ## Technical Constraints
       445    
       446 -  ### Phase 1: Project Setup & Foundation (TDD)
       447 -  - [ ] Initialize Vite + React + TypeScript project
       448 -  - [ ] Configure Vitest + React Testing Library
       449 -  - [ ] Set up Tailwind CSS
       450 -  - [ ] Install dependencies (Tone.js, Zustand, Dexie, lamejs)
       451 -  - [ ] Create basic project structure
       452 -  - [ ] Set up Web Audio API mocks for testing
       446 +  ### Browser Compatibility
       447 +  - **Target**: Latest Chromium-based browsers (Chrome, Edge, Brave)
       448 +  - **No legacy browser support needed**
       449 +  - **No polyfills required**
       450    
       451 -  ### Phase 2: Audio Engine Core (TDD)
       452 -  - [ ] **Metronome Module**
       453 -    - [ ] Write tests for BPM calculation
       454 -    - [ ] Implement Tone.js Transport integration
       455 -    - [ ] Visual callback system
       456 -  - [ ] **Recorder Module**
       457 -    - [ ] Write tests for MediaRecorder setup
       458 -    - [ ] Implement microphone capture
       459 -    - [ ] WAV blob conversion
       460 -  - [ ] **Mixer Module**
       461 -    - [ ] Write tests for multi-track playback
       462 -    - [ ] Implement GainNode per track
       463 -    - [ ] Solo/mute logic
       451 +  ### Audio Storage
       452 +  - **Format**: Uncompressed WAV for all stored tracks
       453 +  - **Rationale**: Maintains maximum quality, export compression happens only on demand
       454 +  - **Trade-off**: Larger storage footprint acceptable for target use case

       531 -  ### Future Features (Out of Scope for v1)
       532 -  - **Time Signature Support** - Currently assumes 4/4
       533 -  - **Punch-in Recording** - Record from middle, auto-splice
       534 -  - **Effects** - Reverb, EQ, compression
       535 -  - **MIDI Import** - Import backing tracks
       536 -  - **Cloud Storage** - Sync projects across devices
       537 -  - **Collaboration** - Share projects with others
       538 -  - **Mobile Support** - Touch-optimized UI
       539 -  - **Waveform Editing** - Trim, fade in/out
       540 -  
       541 -  ### Technical Decisions to Revisit
       542 -  - **Audio Format**: WAV is large; consider storing as compressed format?
       543 -  - **Max Tracks**: 8 per part seems reasonable, but may need adjustment
       544 -  - **Browser Compatibility**: Test on older browsers, polyfills needed?
       545 -

     # SATB Harmony Recorder - Implementation Plan
     This document outlines the implementation phases and tasks for building the SATB Harmony Recorder
     application. Each task references EARS requirements from [DESIGN.md](./DESIGN.md).
     ## Development Approach
     **Test-Driven Development (TDD) - Red-Green-Refactor Loop:**
     1. **Red**: Write a failing test for the requirement
     2. **Green**: Write minimal code to make the test pass
     3. **Refactor**: Improve code quality while keeping tests green

  Ready to start Phase 1 (Project Setup & Foundation)?

> oh! I also need to play tones to know where to start. Let's add a simple 12-tone tone generator, 
centered around A440, to the right of the microphone selector interface. If we can render it as simple 
piano keys that would be nice, but also just the note names would be fine too if that's easier. 

⏺ Great addition! A pitch pipe is super helpful for finding your starting note. Let me update both design
   documents to include a 12-tone generator.

⏺ Perfect! I've added the tone generator feature to both design documents. Here's what's been updated:

  docs/DESIGN.md - Updates

  Added ToneGenerator Module:
  - 12-tone chromatic scale from C4 (261.63 Hz) to B4 (493.88 Hz), including A440
  - Positioned to the right of microphone selector
  - Play tone on click/press, stop on release or second click
  - Optional piano key visual styling

  6 New EARS Requirements (TONE-001 through TONE-006):
  - TONE-001: Provide tone generator for pitch reference
  - TONE-002: 12 chromatic tones (C4 to B4, includes A440)
  - TONE-003: Display to right of microphone selector
  - TONE-004: Play tone on button click/press
  - TONE-005: Stop tone on release or second click
  - TONE-006: Render as piano keys OR labeled note buttons

  Updated UI Layout:
  │ Microphone: [Select Device ▼]  |  Pitch: [C][C#][D][D#][E][F][F#][G][G#][A][A#][B] │

  Added Components:
  - ToneGenerator.tsx - UI component
  - toneGenerator.ts - Audio engine module using Tone.js oscillators

  docs/IMPLEMENTATION.md - Updates

  Phase 3.2: ToneGenerator Module (8 tasks)
  - Tests for initialization, 12-tone scale, playback, stop behavior
  - Tone.js oscillator setup and frequency mapping

  Phase 4.4: ToneGenerator Component (7 tasks)
  - UI with 12 tone buttons (note names)
  - Click/press to play, release/click to stop
  - Optional piano key styling

  EARS Coverage Checklist:
  - Added 6 TONE requirements to checklist
  - Updated total: 82 EARS requirements (was 76)

  The tone generator will give you a chromatic octave (C-B) with A440 in the middle - perfect for finding
   your starting pitch! Ready to begin Phase 1 implementation?

> Great! Now let's also write a project CLAUDE.md. Let's be sure to remind ourselves in particular to use
 a red-green-refactor loop for all new development, to always use EARS specs to track requirements, and 
to always add comments in the code for the EARS requirement that the code is being written for, so that 
we can trace expectations & requirements through the system. 

⏺ Perfect! Let me create a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file for this project with those key reminders.

     # CLAUDE.md
     This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this
     repository.
     ## Project Overview
     **SATB Harmony Recorder** - A browser-based single-page application for recording multi-track vocal
     harmonies (Soprano, Alto, Tenor, Bass). Users can record multiple takes per voice part, overdub, mix
      with individual track controls, and export as WAV/MP3.
     **Tech Stack:**
     - Vite + React 18 + TypeScript
     … +591 lines (ctrl+o to expand)

⏺ Perfect! I've created a comprehensive CLAUDE.md file that emphasizes the three critical principles you
  requested:

  Key Highlights:

  1. Red-Green-Refactor Loop - MANDATORY

  - Clear 3-step process with "No exceptions" policy
  - Multiple code examples showing the complete TDD workflow
  - Explicit reminder to write tests FIRST

  2. EARS Requirements Tracking

  - Lists all 82 requirements across 11 categories
  - Shows how to reference EARS IDs in test names
  - Includes implementation checklist references

  3. Code Comments for Traceability

  - Mandatory format: // [EARS: SPEC-ID] Brief description
  - Extensive examples throughout the document:
  // [EARS: REC-001] Request microphone permissions
  async function requestMicrophone() { ... }

  // [EARS: TRACK-007] Mute flag preserves volume/GainNode
  const applyMute = (track: Track, gainNode: GainNode) { ... }
  - Explains WHY this matters (future developers, debugging, impact analysis)

  Other Important Sections:

  - Complete TDD Example - Shows red-green-refactor for MET-003 (BPM input)
  - Project-Specific Patterns - Auto-save, mute as boolean, overdub toggle, tone frequencies
  - Test Naming Convention - Include EARS IDs in test descriptions
  - Pre-Commit Checklist - Ensures nothing gets committed without tests and EARS comments
  - DO/DON'T Lists - Quick reference for key practices

  The document is practical and code-heavy with real examples from this project. Every code snippet shows
   proper EARS comment usage!
